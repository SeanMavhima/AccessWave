# AccessWave
We are developing Access Wave, an intelligent access solution using RFID cards, readers, and computer programs to enhance access into schools, colleges, and other public and private places. The technology replaces traditional means of gaining access to facilities like codes and keys with faster, more secure, and convenient access control.

The solution targets schools, businesses, and government agencies with the mission of augmenting security and convenience for students, employees, and visitors. By making entry quick and secure, it improves safety, does away with delays, and provides valuable data on attendance and space use, making it an essential tool for optimizing resources in these environments.
